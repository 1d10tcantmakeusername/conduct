# Attention, all of you, vnimanie and achtung!
### Get your fighting and squabbling in **NOW!**

##### Why?
* It entertains everyone else
* You won't have bottled up any animosity, unlike with enforced civility
* It's going against the grain of the trend in most of software development

##### How?
* Argue about whatever the point of contention is in a dedicated debate/arguing channel
* Challenge your opponent to a soy-duel (if images are supported in the communications channel)
* Challenge your opponent to a fight in a video game
* Challenge your opponent to a game of 4D Chess (or something like that, yeah)
* Something along these lines.

Just don't bicker about irrelevant topics in the main coordination channels
